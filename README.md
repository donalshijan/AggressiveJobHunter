# Intention
This is an attempt at building a Job application Agent, which would help people in hunting and applying for jobs, allowing them to keep their sanity by offsetting the soul draining task of visiting multiple job posting sites, searching, applying filters and then going through the application process involving filling up text fields, selecting options, tailoring and uploading Resume/Cover Letter all of which needs to be repeated for multiple suitable job listings, compounding severe Cognitive and psychological exhaustion, only to get a spirit crushing automated response along the lines, "Unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward with your application". So I have come up with an idea to let an AI Agent handle all those tasks autonomously for the applicant. Allowing individuals to use their time more wisely learning and building projects and developing the skills, and not spending countless hours applying.
